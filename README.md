# Specia

Assignment 3 for the Spring 2015 offering of CS 349 (User Interfaces) at
the University of Waterloo.

> **Note**: The current offering of CS 349 has changed significantly since
> Spring 2015 (its technology focus is now Java with Swing and Android
> instead of Web), so I can make this public while being reasonably sure
> this won't cause any issues with respect to academic integrity.

Specia is a HTML5 Canvas-based interactive spaceship. The spaceship is
represented as a scene graph using affine transformations to support
drawing and the various interactions.
